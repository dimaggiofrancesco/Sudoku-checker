# Sudoku-checker  

**Project aim:**  
This was the first project on python. I just wanted to write a simple code  
to check if a sudoku grid was completed correctly or not.  
  
The code runs through the rows first. If the rows are correct it checks the columns and if those  
are also correct, the code runs through the 3X3 squares.
